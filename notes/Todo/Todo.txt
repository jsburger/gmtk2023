ball tech:
	Instance blacklist (replaces "portal" and "launcher" variables)
	Impulse control (special motion add scripts which cap speed appropriately)
	Position Derivative in collision walk back (sub frame velocity vs acceleration vs position etc)
	BallEffects, store changes to ball variables in an array. include cloning for preview.
	Swap out ghost_hits system for ghost_damage or something like that.


Replace pipebomb spawning with something that occurs after board creation. (Fixes pop in)
Add "save" layers to serializers to prepare for save states. Add things like statuses to bricks.
Add and implement RandomSources.
Add global save serializers to be used in scripts.
Rework Player abilities. They're really clunky.
TargetProvider. RoundResetFunctionProvider.
Rewrite enemy moves to use factories instead (wrap the code creation in a function) (fixes clone error)
Hoverable/clickable structs.
