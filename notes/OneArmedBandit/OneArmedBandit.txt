//OLD VERSION

The One-Armed Bandit has a passive ability that causes him to reroll 1 of his 3 
upcoming attacks upon taking damage.

POSSIBLE ACTIONS:
1) RESPIN = Grant 8 Shield
2) BAR    = Deal 3 Damage, Create a layer of Garbage Bricks
3) PAYOUT = 25% to deal 25 Damage, double the odds of any future PAYOUTS this turn to hit

This current iteration isn't fun and his hard to design around. Being able to reroll his attacks is
supposed to give agency but instead feels random and pointless. He can kill you instantly if you get
unlucky, and his most interesting move, BAR, has no synergy.


//NEW VERSION

Assume that the Bandit will always queue 4 attacks now, the last one being PAYOUT, which CANNOT be rerolled.

Assume that the Bandit's passive now only triggers upon taking Spell Damage, and will reroll all
possible moves instead of just 1 on the timeline.

NEW POSSIBLE ACTIONS:
1) RESPIN   = Grant 4 Shield. PAYOUT will create an additional line of blue bricks.
2) HOTSTUFF = Deal 2 Damage.  PAYOUT will create an additional line of burning red bricks.
3) JACKPOT  = Double the chance of PAYOUT dealing damage.
4) PAYOUT   = Deal damage equal to # of Garbage Bricks, 15% chance of hitting. Create 5 Garbage Bricks.

Assume that Garbage Bricks are now 2x2 squares, are just 1 HP bricks besides the functionality
with PAYOUT's damage. Layouts could perhaps start with a few.
   - Additional bricks spawned by PAYOUT are layered after
