spell rework:
requirements:
	enemy targeting: no friendly fire, only living battlers. have to discover valid targets
		TargetedSpell class that handles this like current system?
	placement options
		click and drag
		drawing preview
		placement checking
		taking editor placers? would need destroying disabled.
		

Combatrunner.current_spell
	left_click, no right click
	done() script which tells combat runner when the spell is done
	cancel click events
	just hardcode the targeting (with EnemyBattler)
